## Setup
In order to get started and run an application you need to have:
- [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/)
- [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/)
- [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
- [Cabal](https://wiki.haskell.org/Cabal/How_to_install_a_Cabal_package)

## Running
In order to run the application you need to:
- Clone the repository or download
- Open command line and type `cd xx` where xx - is the name of repository which should be `calc`
- After you changed directory you need to `stack build' to build the application and then `stack exec calc' to run the application
- Alternatively you can `cd xx` where xx is the name of directory and then type into command line `stack runghc Main.hs` and it shloud launch the application
- After you have launched the application, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
